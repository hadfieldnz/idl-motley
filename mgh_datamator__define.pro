; CLASS:
;   MGH_Datamator
;
; PURPOSE:
;   A window for displaying & managing picture sequences.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       Widgets, Object Graphics.
;
; PROPERTIES:
;   The following properties (ie keywords to the Init, GetProperty &
;   SetProperty methods) are supported:
;
;     BUFFER_RESOLUTION (Init, Get, Set)
;       Resolution for off-screen buffers, used by
;       WritePictureToClipboard, WritePictureToImageFile and
;       WritePictureToVRML methods.
;
;     CHANGEABLE (Init, Get)
;       This property determines whether the ANIMATION property can be
;       changed once it has been first set. It is 1 (on) by default;
;       it should be set to 0 when the MGH_Datamator is to be used in
;       a composite application which needs to ensure that the
;       ANIMATION is not changed behind its back.
;
;     DISPLAY (Init, Get, Set)
;       This property specifies whether the Display (aka Draw) method
;       will be called (to display the current frame) when the AddItem
;       method is called. The default is 1 (to display). There are two
;       reasons why it might be appropriate to set DISPLAY to zero:
;         * To improve load time (sometimes by a large margin) at the
;         cost of user feedback.
;         * To inhibit display of partial frames, when the animation
;         contains more than one sequence. In this case the Display
;         method can be called once the new frame has been completely
;         assembled.
;
;     DIMENSIONS (Init, Get, Set)
;       A 2-element array specifying the width & height of the
;       graphics window. If the picture and the window are both
;       "fittable"  (see FITTABLE keyword) then UNITS & DIMENSIONS are
;       taken from the picture.
;
;     FITTABLE (Init, Get)
;       This property determines whether the window will try to resize
;       itself to fit the graphics tree. Default is 1 (try to fit) by
;       default. For a fit to occur, the picture must also be
;       fittable, as determined by the MGH_PICTURE_IS_FITTABLE
;       function.
;
;     FINISHED (Init, Get, Set)
;       This is a flag specifying whether the loading of frames into
;       the animation has finished. The value can be set via a menu
;       item. It is recommended that the routine controlling the
;       animator should check the value of this flag regularly via the
;       Finished method and skip the remaining frames if the flag has
;       been set.
;
;     GRAPHICS_TREE (Init, Get, Set)
;       A reference to the graphics tree that is drawn when the
;       animator's Draw method is called. The graphics tree object is
;       contained in the ANIMATION object. When the GRAPHICS_TREE
;       object is changed, then other aspects of the animator's
;       state are chacked to ensure they are consistent with it.
;
;     MOUSE_ACTION (Init, Get, Set)
;       A 3-element string array specifying the mouse handler object
;       to be associated with each mouse button. Mouse press, release
;       & motion events which originate from the draw widget are sent
;       to "mouse handler" objects, one handler per mouse button. The
;       SetProperty method is responsible for managing these
;       objects. Each time a new value of MOUSE_ACTION is passed to
;       SetProperty this method destroys all existing mouse handlers
;       then creates a new set according to rules hard-wired into the
;       code.
;
;     MOUSE_LIST (Init, Get)
;       This property is a string array that defines the set of values
;       available from the "mouse action" droplists on the status
;       bar. Note that this property affects the user interface
;       only. It does not affect the range of permissible values for
;       the elements of MOUSE_ACTION--these values are determined by
;       the code in SetProperty.
;
;     N_FRAMES (Get)
;       The number of frames currently managed by the animator. This
;       property (which is inherited from MGH_Animator) is stored in
;       the object structure. It is Updateed as necessary by the
;       CountFrames method, which determines it from the animation's
;       COUNT property.
;
;     RESIZEABLE (Init, Get)
;       This property controls what action is taken in response to
;       resize events. Valid values are:

;         0: Base resizing does not change the window or picture
;         dimensions.
;
;         1: Base resizing changes the window & picture dimensions.
;
;         2: Base resizing changes the window & picture dimensions in
;         such a way that the aspect ratio is preserved. This is the
;         default. The resizing of the window interacts with the
;         automatic fitting of the window to the picture, in a way
;         that depends on whether the picture is fittable
;         (i.e. function MGH_PICTURE_IS_FITTABLE returns 1) and
;         whether the window is fittable (FITTABLE property is 1).
;
;     RESOLUTION (Get)
;       Taken from the graphics window.
;
;     TITLE (Get)
;       The title, which appears in the title bar, is calculated from
;       the animation name.
;
;     UNITS (Init, Get, Set)
;       Units for the DIMENSIONS.
;
;     VISIBLE (Init, Set)
;       Set this property to 1 to make the window visible, 0 to make
;       it invisible.
;
;   ... and many more.
;
; METHODS:
;   Include the following
;
;     Finish (Procedure)
;       Set the FINISHED property to 1. This method should be called
;       when loading of frames is completed.
;
;     Finished (Function)
;       Check the value of the FINISHED property, after first flushing
;       the event queue for the top-level base. A program that is
;       adding frames to an MGH_Datamator object should call this
;       method before every frame and break out of the loop if it
;       returns 1. This gives the user an opportunity to terminate the
;       loading of frames.
;
;     WriteAnimationToMovieFile (Procedure):
;       Export the animation in bitmap form to a movie file
;       (multi-frame image file or zipped collection of images).
;
;     WritePictureToClipboard (Procedure):
;     WritePictureToImageFile (Procedure):
;     WritePictureToGraphicsFile (Procedure):
;     WritePictureToVRML (Procedure):
;       Export the current frame of the animation in one of several
;       formats. These methods were all copied verbatim from
;       MGH_Window--code re-use by cut & paste!
