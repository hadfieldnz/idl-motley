<p><span lang="en-NZ">Motley is a library of <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/">IDL</a>
code written largely by me at <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz/">NIWA</a>.
It is provided to the IDL community under the MIT Open Source
License:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"><font color="#408080"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en-NZ"><span style="background: #e8f2fe">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</span></span></font></font></a></p>
<p lang="en-NZ">The library is a collection of the routines that I
use regularly and that I think might be of interest to others. There
are several Object Graphics classes, a base class for widget
applications and several applications built on it, functions that
make it easy to represent scaled data on axes, classes for accessing
netCDF files and several utility routines. You will notice that the
names begin with my initials, MGH. This is not egotism (well, OK,
just a little) but an attempt to avoid naming conflicts with other
software collections.
</p>
<p><span lang="en-NZ">This version of the library requires </span><em><span lang="en-NZ">IDL
8.2</span></em><span lang="en-NZ">. It has been developed &amp;
tested on Windows XP and Linux. If it doesn&rsquo;t work on your
platform, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it. </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-NZ">I have made no effort to keep the routines in Motley
independent of each other, so if you want to use one you're advised
to install the lot. The procedure is:
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-NZ">Download the
	library in <a href="motley.zip">.zip</a> or <a href="motley.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>
	format. </span>
	</p>
	<li/>
<p lang="en-NZ" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Unpack the files to
	a directory and add it to your IDL path.
	</p>
	<li/>
<p lang="en-NZ">Before using any of the routines in the
	library in any IDL session, run the initialisation routine with the
	command &quot;mgh_motley&quot;. You may eventually want to add this
	command to your startup script.
	</p>
</ol>
<p lang="en-NZ">Generally the Motley library does not require any
routines outside the standard IDL library. Occasionally I make
exceptions; in this case my policy is to bundle a copy of the
required routine, with permission of the author. I try to keep these
bundled routines up to date, but you may want to check the author&rsquo;s
WWW site for a more recent copy. Currently the bundled routines are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-NZ">IMDISP by
	<a href="http://www.gumley.com/">Liam Gumley</a>, used in an example
	program. </span>
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><span lang="en-NZ">CMUNIQUE_ID by <a href="http://astrog.physics.wisc.edu/%7Ecraigm/idl/idl.html">Craig
	Markwardt</a>.</span></p>
</ul>
<p lang="en-NZ">Finally, the library includes a modified form of
RSI&rsquo;s CW_PALETTE_EDITOR. The modified routine is called
MGH_CW_PALETTE_EDITOR and is included with permission of RSI, who
retain copyright. For a list of the modifications, see the modified
source code.
